Runs "opengenera2" inside virtualbox using vagrant, veewee, and chef.

This *does not include* genera. It requires that you supply a bzip2 tar archive named opengenera.tar.bz2 with the (abridged) files listed in notes/opengenera2.tar.list.

To launch a virtualbox VM running genera, run

    make && vagrant up

This will create an ubuntu-8.04.4-server-amd64 drive image that is staged for use with vagrant. Practically this means sizing a new disk image, installing the OS with specific settings, installing some base ruby packages, creating a vagrant user, etc (http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/base_boxes.html). Vagrant will then launch this image in virtual box and set up port forwarding (2222 -> vm 22, 5902 -> vm 5901). On launch, chef-solo is used to evaluate the opengenera cookbook, which jumps through some hoops to set up opengenera (see notes/*), and run it inside a VNC session.

After the server is running, you can use opengenera by opening:

    vnc://localhost:5902 password "genera"

Open Genera setup:

    "login Lisp-Machine"
    "define site <sitename>"
    Left click value of "Namespace Server Name". Change to "genera"
    Left click value of "Unix Host Name". Change to "genera-host"
    Left click "<end> uses these values"
    Type return to login anonymously
    ":reset network"
    
    ;;; "save world" ; not working :(

Enjoy!
